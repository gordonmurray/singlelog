# SingleLog

The last logging solution you'll ever need

SingleLog is a combination of vector.dev, AWS S3 and SingleStore for consuming, storing and searching logs in a cost effective manner.


### Validate

[Inspec](https://www.inspec.com/) is used to validate that the webserver and singlstore instance are running as expected after running Terraform

### Cost

[Infracost](https://www.infracost.io/) is used to estimate the costs of this project.

Assumes 1 TB of data stored in s3, standard tier with a lot of requests.
